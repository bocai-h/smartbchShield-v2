The <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://medium.com/suterusu/an-introduction-to-the-suterusu-protocol-fe890bc49ead\">Suterusu protocol</a> is based on our original <a href=\"https://medium.com/suterusu/new-development-on-the-zk-consnark-scheme-8a4ec673bbb4\" target=\"_blank\">ZK-ConSNARK</a> technology, which strikes a perfect balance between performance and security.",

  "Register": "Register",
  "RegisterDescription": "The user can register a new Suter account by inputting a random private key. The corresponding public key is the identifier of the newly created Suter account.",
  "FundDescription": "The user invokes the fund module and converts ETH or ERC-20 to Suter-ETH or Suter-ERC-20 token. The converted token will be added to the new account using homomorphic public-key encryption. The native token will be sent to the fund contract, which would be like a stream of water entering an ocean.",
  "TransferDescription": "The user can then select a receiver Suter account to send the converted token. This receiver Suter account can be either generated by himself or sent from the others. The transfer of the converted token will be anonymous and confidential since we will invoke the ZK-ConSNARK technique to guarantee the Suter account anonymity and the confidentiality of the transferred amount. ",
  "BurnDescription": "The user can then invoke the burn module and convert the Suter-token back to its original form. As long as the user uses a different Ethereum account to invoke this module from the fund module, the connection between the funded token and the burned token is severed. ",
  "Slogan3": "<a href=\"https://medium.com/suterusu/why-suterusus-privacy-preserving-defi-solution-based-on-zk-consnark-is-superior-to-the-existing-dbc0af45bb0c\" target=\"_blank\">Why <strong>Suter Shield</strong>&nbsp; has better Privacy Protection</a>",
  "Slogan3Description1": "The connection between Suter account and Ethereum address is severed through invoking the fund module. When the attacker traces the payment records of Ethereum address, it would be like tracing the direction of a small stream of water, you cannot predict where the stream goes when it reaches the ocean. ",
  "Slogan3Description2": "The miners might still be able to observe the payment records between different Suter accounts when they verify the transactions. We adopt homomorphic public key encryption to ensure the transferred amount confidentiality and apply zero-knowledge proof to guarantee the anonymity of the Suter accounts.",
